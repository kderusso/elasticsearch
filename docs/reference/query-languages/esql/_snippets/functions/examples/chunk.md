| 1211 | The brothers Karamazov | In 1880 Dostoevsky completed The Brothers Karamazov, the literary effort for which he had been preparing all his life. Compelling, profound, complex, it is the story of a patricide and of the four sons who each had a motive for murder: Dmitry, the sensualist, Ivan, the intellectual, Alyosha, the mystic, and twisted, cunning Smerdyakov, the bastard child. Frequently lurid, nightmarish, always brilliant, the novel plunges the reader into a sordid love triangle, a pathological obsession, and a gripping courtroom drama. But throughout the whole, Dostoevsky searhes for the truth--about man, about life, about the existence of God. A terrifying answer to man's eternal questions, this monumental work remains the crowning achievement of perhaps the finest novelist of all time. From the Paperback edition. |
| 1463 | Realms of Tolkien: Images of Middle-earth | Twenty new and familiar Tolkien artists are represented in this fabulous volume, breathing an extraordinary variety of life into 58 different scenes, each of which is accompanied by appropriate passage from The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion |
| 1502 | Selected Passages from Correspondence with Friends | Nikolai Gogol wrote some letters to his friends, none of which were a nose of high rank. Many are reproduced here (the letters, not noses). |
| 1937 | The Best Short Stories of Dostoevsky (Modern Library) | This collection, unique to the Modern Library, gathers seven of Dostoevsky's key works and shows him to be equally adept at the short story as with the novel. Exploring many of the same themes as in his longer works, these small masterpieces move from the tender and romantic White Nights, an archetypal nineteenth-century morality tale of pathos and loss, to the famous Notes from the Underground, a story of guilt, ineffectiveness, and uncompromising cynicism, and the first major work of existential literature. Among Dostoevsky's prototypical characters is Yemelyan in The Honest Thief, whose tragedy turns on an inability to resist crime. Presented in chronological order, in David Magarshack's celebrated translation, this is the definitive edition of Dostoevsky's best stories. |
| 1985 | Brothers Karamazov | Four brothers reunite in their hometown in Russia. The murder of their father forces the brothers to question their beliefs about each other, religion, and morality. |
