**Description**

Use `CHUNK` to split a text field into smaller chunks.

Chunk can be used on fields from the text famiy like [text](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/text.md) and [semantic_text](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/semantic-text.md).
    Chunk will split a text field into smaller chunks, using a sentence-based chunking strategy.

    The number of chunks returned, and the length of the sentences used to create the chunks can be specified.

    Chunks may be rescored based on their relevance to a specified query.
    If a query is provided, chunks will be scored based on BM25 text search matches for that query.
    A smaller number of chunks than requested may be returned if there aren't enough matches for the query.
    If no chunks match the provided text query, chunks will be returned in the order in which they appear in the document.
